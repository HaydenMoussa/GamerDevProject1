# Save The Fish

In this game you control an F-150 and have to move it around a fish to block incoming sharks.

As far as narrative goes there isn't much. We just think it is funny to have a car flying around the screen blocking incoming sharks.

You must use your mouse to move to car, when the car comes in contact with a shark it is blocked and removed from the scene.

We went for an underwater aesthetics.

One of the joys for me was picking out the sprites, I probably spent more time on that than anything else. -Hayden

I enjoyed making the background processes for the score system work - niko

joys and struggles while writing this game

The hardest part for me was making the GameManageer as it was referncing things in both scenes and required me to learn a new way of referencing objects. - Niko

a paragraph discussing the contributions of each team member to the final game.

For this project I mainly worked on the Shark Enemy mechanics. I created the enemy and the script that controls it as well as the scripts for the car to block the sharks. I implamented the randomness of the shark spawn and the increase in difficulty as the fish survives for longer. I also picked out and implamented the sprites used for the game. -Hayden

For this project I made the score saving functionanlity and the scoreboard. I was in charge of making the particles and audio. I also made the game manager and movement script for the shield. -niko
